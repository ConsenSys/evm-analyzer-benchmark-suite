# EVM Analyzer Benchmark Suite

This repo is a fork of Suhabe Bugara's excellent benchmark suite for evaluating the precision of EVM code analysis tools. If you have a benchmark that you would like to contribute, please submit it as a pull request.

The link below shows the results of running some tools on these benchmarks:

Eventually these tools will be added to this repository.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/EthereumAnalysisBenchmarks/evm-analyzer-benchmark-suite/wiki) for commentary around the benchmarks.
